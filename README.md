# Facial-Emotion-Detection

* This project is about Emotion Detection using VGG-16. OpenCV is also used to implement real-time emotion detection using the trained model. It can detect the following emotions: angry, happy, sad, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral.

* Tensorflow libraries are used to implement model training using the device's GPU rather than the CPU. This significantly decreases the training time. The IDE used is JupyterLab.

### Dataset used

* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge  

The data set is FER2013 which is an open-source data set that was made publicly available for a Kaggle competition. It consists of 48 X 48-pixel grayscale images of human faces. There are seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) present in the dataset.
